Creating Gender Classifier using Scikit Learn Library

Given the height, weight, and shoe size our model can classify whether the given data belongs to a male or female.
We use Scikit Learn Library, and use the Decision Tree Classifier Module

**DecisionTreeClassifier**
DecisionTreeClassifier is a class capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset.
As with other classifiers, DecisionTreeClassifier takes as input two arrays: an array X, sparse or dense, of shape (n_samples, n_features) holding the training samples, and an array Y of integer values, shape (n_samples,), holding the class labels for the training samples
After being fitted, the model can then be used to predict the class of samples:
